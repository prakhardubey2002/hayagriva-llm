Package: hayagriva-llm
Version: 1.0.0

Description:
Structured LLM metadata standard for Node.js packages — llm.package.json and llm.package.txt

Summary:
Hayagriva-llm is a CLI tool that generates structured LLM metadata files (llm.package.json and llm.package.txt) for Node.js packages. It analyzes package manifests and source code to create comprehensive AI-readable descriptions of package functionality, helping AI systems better understand and interact with npm packages. The tool integrates seamlessly with existing package.json workflows and supports TypeScript analysis for accurate type information.

When to use:
Use Hayagriva-llm when you want to make your Node.js package more discoverable and understandable by AI systems. It's particularly valuable for package authors who want their libraries to be properly interpreted by AI assistants, documentation generators, or automated code analysis tools. Choose this package when you need to generate standardized metadata that describes your package's functionality in a structured format that AI systems can parse and utilize.

Reason to use:
- Generates structured LLM metadata automatically
- Improves AI discoverability of your package
- Creates both JSON and text format descriptions
- Integrates with existing package.json workflows
- Supports TypeScript analysis for accurate type information
- Provides CLI interface for easy integration into build processes

Use cases:
- Generating metadata for npm packages to improve AI assistant responses
- Creating standardized package descriptions for automated documentation systems
- Enhancing package searchability in AI-powered code repositories
- Providing structured data for AI code completion tools
- Documenting package functionality for machine learning model training
- Automating metadata generation in CI/CD pipelines

Side effects:
- reads package.json
- analyzes source code
- writes llm.package.json and llm.package.txt files

Exports:
- cli : Starts the Hayagriva CLI, parsing command-line arguments and dispatching to the appropriate command handler. It initializes the application state, loads configuration, and runs the selected operation such as serving documentation or processing files. — params: args?: string[] (optional command-line arguments, defaults to process.argv.slice(2)) — returns: Promise<void> (resolves when the CLI process completes) — side effect — e.g. cli(['serve', '--port', '3000'])
